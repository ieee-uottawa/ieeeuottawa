Since then, the IEEE has opened up a lot of doors for me. I have met some truly remarkable people along the way that have helped me grow and mature as a person. I want to give back to the IEEE, an organization that has given me so much over years, in hopes that the next generation can benefit in the same way that I did. Last year I was super excited to take on the role of Vice-Chair for the IEEE uOttawa Student Branch. I founded the IEEE Coding Challenge where students compete in solving difficult computer science problems while at the same time preparing for the kind of technical questions that come up on interviews. Furthermore, I was honored to be a mentor for the IEEE Cookies and Cram sessions, where I helped first year students prepare for their ITI1120 exams. I was also very active in the office revamp initiative where we added new furniture and appliances to the IEEE office to make it more comfortable spot for students to come and study. Over the past three years I have been a very active promoter of the IEEE by encouraging first year students to get more involved through volunteering opportunities and various events offered by the IEEE. I am ecstatic to see that those same students are now running for exec positions for the branch. This year I plan to come back as Vice-chair and continue my work on <strong>making the IEEE Student Branch great again.</strong> I will continue to build on the success of the IEEE Coding Challenge by offering more events that will prepare and help students land good CO-OP jobs. Ultimately, I want to continue the amazing work that Heemel and the rest of the IEEE execs have worked hard to achieve this year. I am committed to maintaining the highest standard of leadership that has supported the IEEE Student Branch since its inception.</p>"

Being involved through many events across the campus have allowed me to talk to students across different programs from the engineering faculty. I observed that students from Electrical Engineering program are disadvantaged in the job market and most students have great difficulty finding internships. Many students during 2nd year of student are unable to find summer jobs and most that do not work with positions of their interest. My goal is to provide more opportunities for student that are in Electrical Engineering program. During my time as VP social, I have also noticed that students become more school oriented as they progress through the program. This led me to believe that the best way to bring in engagement from students is to introduce lucrative job opportunities. I will be doing several co-op terms in the future and I am beginning mine first one during this summer. I am planning to work at more large companies in the future and establish strong connections with these companies and professional organizations.
